Project: Real-World Asset (RWA) Valuation and Oracle Integration Idea

Objective:
Build a system that allows users to tokenize real-world assets (cars, houses, watches, etc.) by first performing a price valuation through a simulated oracle process. In the future, this can be upgraded to a real Chainlink oracle and real-world APIs.

Workflow:
1. User inputs an asset name (e.g., "Ferrari 458", "3-bedroom house").
2. Frontend sends a request to a backend endpoint: /api/oracle-lookup?assetName=<name>
3. Backend simulates a third-party price oracle:
   - Generates a realistic random price range (e.g., 50kâ€“500k USD).
   - Optionally, based on asset type (e.g., car, house).
4. Backend returns the valuation to the frontend.
5. Frontend displays the valuation to the user with an explanation like:
   - "Oracle DeFiAI valued your Ferrari 458 at $220,000."
6. User can confirm to "Tokenize Asset" using this valuation.
7. Frontend sends a /api/tokenize call including:
   - Asset Name
   - TokenURI (metadata with price information embedded)
8. Backend mints an NFT representing the tokenized asset with its valuation.
9. In the future:
   - Replace fake valuation with Chainlink Any API connection.
   - Integrate real-world external APIs (e.g., Kelley Blue Book, Zillow, WatchBox).

Asset Health/Existence Verification (Future Plan):
- Require asset serial numbers (VIN, property address, SKU) during submission.
- Cross-reference asset data with 3rd party APIs.
- Simulate a proof-of-reserve check.
- Upgrade later to Chainlink Proof-of-Reserve or Proof-of-Existence oracle feeds.

Benefits:
- More realistic simulation of asset valuation flows for tokenization.
- Easier future upgrade path to Chainlink oracles.
- Stronger project presentation: explain simulated vs future real-world connection.
